Personal project exploring my iPhone's health data.

TODO

1. 3D visualization of step data:
    x-axis - date (yyyy-mm-dd)
    y-axis - time of day (hh:mm) (use buckets)
    z-axis - number of steps

    topological visualization of steps during the day, throughout the year

    In order to do this ->

    1. need a visualization.py file
    2. should separate out data cleaning utilities into it's own py file (eventually)
